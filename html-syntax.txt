here we start our html journey

<tag>content that we want to</tag>

there are somes tags or html elements that are basics in html 

html program will be started from the following style :-

<1doctype>       - first documemt type 
<html>           - every  html file starts wht this tag 
<head></head>    - then we use to give a valid head according to our program and this tag contents are not visible in the main web pages
<title></title>  - this content contains the titlee of the file that are creating 
<body></body>    - the main part the html file is body .. all the elaments and the contents in this is visible in the web page
</html>          - the closing tag of the html file ..

#note that every html element and its tag will have a opening and a closing tag , except some where closing tags are by defult or are not required to be given
